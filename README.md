## Technical Challenge

Create a web application for querying the current weather of a location (name of city). The application should have three screens with mentioned fields.

### Screen 1. 
- Login: User should be able to login with his username and password. Logout link should be present on the landing page (current weather).

### Screen 2. 
- Registration: User should be able to register with the application with only username (email), password, and date of birth.

### Screen 3. 
- Current Weather and history: User should be able to search weather conditions based on the city name. Use the OpenWeatherMap API to get the result.
- Display of result should be in tabular form.
- The search should be added to a history table. Searched results should be stored in the database.
- History Table: User should be able to delete and bulk delete the rows from the history table.
- Logout: User should be able to logout.
- Consider frontend and backend user input validation.

## Database: 
Create an appropriate relational database schema, including foreign key relations and constraints.

### Technology Stack:
#### Mandatory:
- Golang (including Unittests)
- React
- REST API (REST Web services) (add, edit, and delete) database CRUD operations

### Not mandatory:
- You can choose any (relational) database or ORM framework
- You can choose any logging framework

## Important implementation aspects: 
- External API access error handling/logging
- Code structure and general architecture of the solution
- Dependency management (frontend and backend)

### Setting Up the Application:
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the frontend and backend directories and follow the specific setup instructions provided in each directory's README files.

### Running the Application:
- Follow the instructions in the frontend and backend README files to start the frontend and backend servers.

### Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter any issues during setup or execution, please reach out to me for assistance.
