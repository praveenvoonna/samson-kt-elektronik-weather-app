# Technical Challenge

Create a web application for querying the current weather of a location (name of city).
The application should have three screens with mentioned fields.
## Screen 1. 
Login: User should be able to login with his user name and password. Logout
link should be present on landing page (current weather).
## Screen 2. 
Registration: User should be able to register with application with
only username (email), password and date of birth
## Screen 3. 
Current Weather and history: User should be able to search weather conditions based on city name. Use https://openweathermap.org/current api to get
result.
• Display of result should be in tabular form.
• The search should be added to a history table. Searched result should be stored in database.
• History Table: User should be able to delete and bulk delete the rows from history table.
• Logout: User should be able to logout.
• Consider frontend and backend user input validation.
## Database: 
Create an appropriate relational data base schema, including foreign key
relations and constraints.
All above functional requirements are mandatory to implement within given time.
You can choose your own idea to validate the input.
## Technology Stack:
### Mandatory:
Golang (including Unittests)
React
REST API (REST Web services) (add, edit and delete) database CRUD operations
### Not mandatory:
You can choose any (relational) database or ORM framework
You can choose any logging framework
## Important implementation aspects: (considered to assess your solution)
• External API access error handling / logging
• Code structure and general architecture of the solution
• Dependency management (frontend and backend)
